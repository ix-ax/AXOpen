# ix.framework

`ix.framework` (IXF) intends to be an application framework for industrial automation applications based on [SIMATIC AX](https://simatic-ax.siemens.io) and [IX](https://github.com/ix-ax/ix).

IXF is an object-oriented framework that keeps the hard real-time operation in the PLC controller but extends the reach into the .NET framework and thus provides a large overlap into the IT domain.

**This project is under development, stay tuned for the upcoming releases.**
