`AXOpen` (AXO), is an innovative application framework for industrial automation applications. This project leverages the capabilities of [SIMATIC AX](https://simatic-ax.siemens.io) and [AX#](https://github.com/ix-ax/axsharp), amalgamating their unique strengths to deliver a comprehensive solution.

AXOpen, engineered with an object-oriented architecture, acts as a bridge between the meticulous, real-time operations of a PLC controller and the extensive adaptability of the .NET framework. This integration ensures unparalleled performance in automation tasks and forms a significant interface with the IT domain, thereby expanding the realm of potential applications.

AXOpen is designed to simplify the development of industrial automation by covering a broad spectrum of areas. These include, but are not limited to, coordination (sequential control), alarm/messaging, components (pneumatics, vision, robotics, etc.), data acquisition, and various utility libraries.

Moreover, AXOpen comprises powerful tools that expedite the development of HMI/UI applications. It builds upon web technologies (Blazor) and the incredibly powerful [AX# library](https://ix-ax.github.io/axsharp/articles/blazor/RENDERABLECONTENT.html) for automated generation of user interfaces. Each library/component within AXOpen comes equipped with ready-to-use visual components, enabling swift deployment in any human-machine interface scenario.

We wish to inform you that AXOpen is currently in its development phase. Our committed team of specialists is diligently working to ensure the final product aligns with our vision of a high-performance, adaptable, and user-friendly framework for industrial automation.

**As we continue to make headway in our developmental journey, we request your patience. Stay tuned for updates regarding the upcoming releases of AXOpen.** Your interest, support, and feedback are invaluable to us and we encourage you to engage with us during the evolution of this project.

To remain updated about our progress, consider starring and subscribing to this repository.
