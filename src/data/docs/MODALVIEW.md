# Modal detail view

The Detail View is default shown like modal view. That means if you click on some record, the modal window with a detail view will be shown. If necessary, this option can be changed with `ModalDetailView` attribute. This change will show a detail view under the record table. Example with `ModalDetailView` attribute:
