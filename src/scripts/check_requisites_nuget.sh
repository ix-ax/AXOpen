To manually add the GitHub NuGet feed to your sources:

1. Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub with 'read:packages', 'write:packages', and 'delete:packages' (if needed) permissions.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.
3. Use the following command to add the feed to your NuGet sources:
   nuget sources Add -Name "GitHub" -Source "$feedUrl" -Username [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME] -Password [YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]

Replace [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME] with your actual GitHub username and [YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN] with the token you generated.

Note: Treat your personal access token like a password. Keep it secure and do not share it.
