# **AXOpen.Inspectors**

**AXOpen.Inspectors** provides mechanism of inspection of different types of data. The input value is compared to required value. If input value is the same as required value for a *stabilization* time period, the inspection will succeed. If values are different, *timeout* will occur and inspection will fail.

Inspectors can integrate with coordination primitives like [AxoSequencer](../core/AXOSEQUENCER.md). In consequence, inspectors offer extended capabilities in decision flow for failed checks.

Each inspector contains:

1. `Inspect` method, which input is current parent and inspection variable
2. `OnFail` method, which provides methods for making a decision after a failed inspection (see Handling failure section)
3. `UpdateComprehensiveResult` method, which input is object of type `AxoComprehesiveResult`, which can be used to gather results of all inspections.

4. `Common data` about inspection inputs and result. See below.

## Simple example inspection

1. Declare variables

[!code-smalltalk[](../../../src/inspectors/app/src/Documentation/Inspectors.st?name=AxoInspectorDeclaration)]

2. Set initial inspection pass and fail timers

[!code-smalltalk[](../../../src/inspectors/app/src/Documentation/Inspectors.st?name=AxoInspectorDataSet)]

3. Run inspections

[!code-smalltalk[](../../../src/inspectors/app/src/Documentation/Inspectors.st?name=AxoInspectorSimpleInspection)]

4. Check each inspector's data for results

> [!NOTE]
> Inspectors use AxOpen.Timers for counting time during inspections. Make sure, that `PLC cycle time` value in `configuration.st` is set accordingly to Pass and Fail timers (it should be in tens or hundreds milliseconds, the value shouldn't higher than lowest difference between pass and fail timers). If there are small differences (in ms) between pass and fail times and `PLC cycle time` is higher number (e.g. 1000 ms), unexpected behavior may occur and inspections can fail (even if they should pass).

## Example inspection with Coordinator
Example of inspection within a sequencer in PLC:


[!code-smalltalk[](../../../src/inspectors/app/src/Documentation/DocumentationContext.st?name=ExampleInspectionWithCoordinatorExample)]


1. A _presenceInspector is created instance of `AxoDigitalInspector`

2. A coordinator is passed to this inspector with `WithCoordinator(THIS)` method, in this case it is a sequencer, a parent object.
3. `Inspect` methods takes parent and inspection variable, on which inspection is performing.
4. If inspection fails, the result is updated to `_comprehensiveResult` object with `UpdateComprehensiveResult` method.
5. If inspection fails, `OnFail` method provides `CarryOn` method, which tells the coordinator to continue in execution.

## Common inspector data

Inspectors contain common data, which are used to store data about inspection. Each inspector contain following data:


[!code-smalltalk[](../../../src/inspectors/ctrl/src/AxoInspectorData.st?name=CommonInspectorDataDeclaration)]



[!INCLUDE [AxoDigitalInspector](AXODIGITALINSPECTOR.md)]

[!INCLUDE [AxoAnalogueInspector](AXOANALOGUEINSPECTOR.md)]

[!INCLUDE [AxoDataInspector](AXODATAINSPECTOR.md)]



## Handling failure

When an inspector fails, OnFail() provides a series of methods for making decisions about the process. In order for this is feature to work the inspector needs to be aware of the coordinator of `IAxoCoordinator`. The coordinator must be passed to the inspector by `WithCoordinator(coordinator)` method.


| Syntax                                | Description |
| -----------                           | ----------- |
| Dialog(inRetryStep, inTerminateStep)  | Opens dialog for the user to take a decision. Parameter `inRetryStep` represent state from which the inspection should start again. Parameter `inTerminateStep` represent terminate state of coordinator.                                       |
| Retry(inRetryStep)                    | Retries the inspector. Retry state parameter tells from which state the inspection should start again.                        |
| Override()                            | Marks the inspection as failed but continues with the following states of the coordinator.                                      |
| Terminate(inTerminateStep)            | Marks the inspection as failed and aborts the execution of the coordinator.                                          |

The following example specify, that when inspection fails, dialog is shown and is requesting user decision.

## Over-inspection
When `RetryAttemptsCount` is same as `NumberOfAllowedRetries`, no more inspection are allowed, as data are overinspected.

## Preserving overall result

Overall result of a series of inspections can be preserved in `AxoComprehensiveResult`. Each inspector has `UpdateComprehensiveResult` method that provides the update function. Once the `UpdateComprehensiveResult` marks the overall result as Failed, successive inspection will not overwrite the result.
